## Different options
- Generate questions page by page, or feed the entire document at once
- Restrict the context (positive/negative) to be existing in the original document, or not
- Restrict the positive context to be answering the query correctly, or just providing relevant information
- Restrict the negative context to be hard negative (find literature to support this assumption)
- Long context (containing multiple sub-contexts) or short context

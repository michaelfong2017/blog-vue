## Base Prompt
```
I have a document and I need to generate (query, positive context, negative context) triplets from it.

Query: A phrase or sentence that represents the main idea or a specific point of interest in the document.
Positive context: A passage or sentence that is highly relevant to the query, providing clear and direct information about it.
Negative context: A passage or sentence that is still quite relevant to the query but is not directly related, making it a hard negative example.
For each triplet, the query should be extracted based on significant themes or ideas in the document. The positive context should closely match the information sought by the query, and the negative context should be related but not directly answering or addressing the query.

Please generate these triplets from the document provided.

I need 10 entries, output comma-separated strings for me here with the following headers:
query,pos,neg

Just output in the console.

|What is a distributed ledger technology?    |DLT refers to a technology architecture where a ledger is replicated across multiple entities, allowing records to be simultaneously accessed, validated and updated.                                                                                                              |Token standards relating to the issuance of DLT tokens (such as ERC20), DLT-related applications, documentation and academic research already exist in the public domain.                                                      |
|What is a smart contract?                   |A smart contract refers to an agreement between participants where the terms, predetermined conditions and outcomes have been coded into a computer program, enabling the agreement and its associated outcomes to be automatically executed when certain conditions have been met.|Programmable payments allow conditions to be imposed to govern when and how payments should be initiated.                                                                                                                      |
|What is an API?                             |An API is a software interface enabling two or more programs (which may be running on the same or different systems) to communicate with each other.                                                                                                                               |The HKMA will continue to examine different architectures for an rCBDC in conjunction with other collaborative work and projects with the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and other central banks.           |
|What are programmable payments?             |Programmable payments allow conditions to be imposed to govern when and how payments should be initiated. Such conditions are typically implemented through the use of a smart contract in conjunction with application programming interfaces (APIs).                             |In contrast, smart contracts enable consumers and businesses to directly embed instructions into an electronic contract to initiate payments once pre-defined conditions are fulfilled.                                        |
|What are tokenised deposits?                |Tokenised deposits have the potential to transform transactions in terms of visibility and execution efficacy, by enabling transacting parties to integrate separate processes, stakeholders, and data points into a unified, end-to-end flow.                                     |In a global first, Visa alongside Hang Seng Bank and HSBC explored in their pilot the atomicity and interoperability of on-us and cross-chain payments across a variety of business scenarios using tokenised deposits.        |
|What is the e-HKD Pilot Programme?          |The e-HKD Pilot Programme launched last year underpins the HKMA’s joint efforts with the industry to experientially evaluate viable applications.                                                                                                                                  |The HKMA embarked on Project e-HKD two years ago to study the case for issuing an rCBDC in Hong Kong.                                                                                                                          |

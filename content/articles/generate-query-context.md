## First Prompt (different from the base by not splitting the document)
```
I have a document and I need to generate (query, positive context, negative context) triplets from it.

Query: A phrase or sentence that represents the main idea or a specific point of interest in the document.
Positive context: A passage or sentence that is highly relevant to the query, providing clear and direct information about it.
Negative context: A passage or sentence that is still quite relevant to the query but is not directly related, making it a hard negative example.
For each triplet, the query should be extracted based on significant themes or ideas in the document. The positive context should closely match the information sought by the query, and the negative context should be related but not directly answering or addressing the query.

Please generate these triplets from the document provided.

I need 10 entries, output comma-separated strings for me here with the following headers:
query,pos,neg

Just output in the console.
```

I have a document and I need to generate (query, positive context, negative context) triplets from it.

Query: A phrase or sentence that represents the main idea or a specific point of interest in the document.
Positive context: A passage or sentence that is highly relevant to the query, providing clear and direct information about it.
Negative context: A passage or sentence that is still quite relevant to the query but is not directly related, making it a hard negative example.
For each triplet, the query should be extracted based on significant themes or ideas in the document. The positive context should closely match the information sought by the query, and the negative context should be related but not directly answering or addressing the query.

Please generate these triplets from the document provided.

Generate 10 entries. Quality is more important than quantity. Output comma-separated strings for me here with the following headers:
query,pos,neg

Use double quotes to enclose all cells. Just output comma-separated strings in the console.

|What are the considerations for issuing a programmable money?                                |A programmable money may potentially undermine the public’s trust in the legal tender. Given the restrictions on how and when it can be spent, it could be considered less valuable compared to other forms of money such as physical cash.                                                                                               |An e-HKD incorporating smart contract functionality could unlock new modes of business transactions between consumers and businesses, and encourage wider adoption of conditional settlements for retail payments.                                                                                   |
|What is the delivery versus payment (DvP) model in fund management?                          |Under this delivery versus payment (DvP) model, the fund manager is exposed to less risk as they have the knowledge and confidence that the investor has already prefunded their order.                                                                                                                                                   |The investor in turn can enjoy faster order execution and a timelier entry to the market, allowing them to potentially benefit from an extra day of interest income, say with the purchase of a tokenised bond.                                                                                      |
|What is fund ring-fencing and how can it be applied to government disbursements?             |A programmable e-HKD could embed fund ring-fencing and tracking functionality, enabling funds with designated spending conditions to be safekept, spent and tracked without requiring the funds to be confined to a single commercial payment channel.                                                                                    |This can be of use where the issuer of a given set of funds may not have a particular affiliation with a commercial payment channel, for instance, the government in issuing subsidies, reimbursements and consumption vouchers to the public.                                                       |
|What are the potential benefits of using an e-HKD for offline payments?                      |A hypothetical e-HKD is stored using secure elements within smartphone wallets and physical smart cards.

|What are the benefits of ringfencing and tracking funds with an e-HKD?                       |A programmable e-HKD could enable the ringfencing and tracking of funds to be achieved with greater ease and less operational overhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |Instead of distributing funds to, for instance, stored value facilities (SVFs) which then configure the restrictions on their platforms, the intended use of the funds could be programmed from the outset to govern how it can be spent irrespective of the payment platform.                       |
|What are the considerations for achieving programmability at scale?                          |It may be worthwhile to consider developing a repository of smart contract templates for common business activities. Technical frameworks, such as cross-system protocols and standards for identifying merchants, would also need to be developed in collaboration with the industry.                                                    |This refers to the process of creating an ecosystem with the necessary infrastructure so that businesses are equipped with the right incentives, resources and expertise to make the most of programmability.                                                                                        |
|What are the potential risks of issuing an rCBDC with programmability features?              |As discussed in an earlier section, an e-HKD issued as a programmable money could run the risk of undermining the public’s trust in the legal tender and in turn, affect monetary and financial stability.                                                                                                                                |For instance, an rCBDC issued as a programmable money may be more susceptible to cybersecurity risks, as it may present more mediums for external threats to inject malicious code.                                                                                                                  |
|What did the consumer surveys reveal about conditional prepayments with e-HKD?               |In one set of surveys, 93% of consumers responded that conditional prepayments with e-HKD could alleviate their concerns of losing their money as a result of a merchant going bankrupt, whilst 70% of merchants responded that conditional prepayments with e-HKD would help build loyalty.                                              |In the “Consumer Protections” pilots, a scalable, “retail escrow” prepayment product facilitating conditional settlements with e-HKD could incentivise businesses to provide good, consistent service from the outset to build trust with consumers.                                                 |
|What is the significance of programmability for consumers and businesses?                    |A programmable e-HKD could unlock new types of transactions for consumers and businesses, by facilitating the wider adoption of conditional settlements for retail transactions. This could create mutual incentives for transacting parties to complete the transaction in a timelier manner.                                            |An e-HKD could also facilitate “open-loop system” conditional settlements, where related payment conditions can apply regardless of the means used to make the payment.                                                                                                                              |

|What is the difference between an e-HKD and stablecoins?                                     |An e-HKD being an rCBDC would observe the singleness of money, where each e-HKD is always equal to a HKD and the underlying exchange rate between these two forms of money remains constant. In contrast, the value of stablecoins or “cryptocurrencies” is subject to fluctuations.                                                      |The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR Government) issued a Policy Statement on Development of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong in October 2022, noting that an e-HKD could serve as a potential “backbone” and anchor to bridge legal tender and virtual assets.           |
|What is atomic settlement?                                                                   |Atomic settlement refers to the ability to settle transactions and exchange assets in a simultaneous, instant and contingent manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |An e-HKD could work in conjunction with the current set of financial infrastructure to enable a wider audience of consumers and businesses to enjoy the benefits of atomic settlement across a greater range of transactions.                                                                        |
|What are the pain points of “last mile” payment processing?                                  |The pain point of “last mile” payment processing is the result of business, operational and technical factors. Whilst new technologies can facilitate the development of faster, more efficient processes, there is a crucial need for business stakeholders and intermediaries to review and align their processes and operational norms.|Financial institutions may also impose additional checks and holds on payments before crediting the funds to businesses, or process payments in batches instead of real-time.                                                                                                                        |

|What is the potential of an e-HKD in offline settings?                                       |An e-HKD could address last mile pain points which may be amplified in offline settings, where consumers and merchants may lack perpetual access to an online network and are forced to handle settlements offline.                                                                                                                       |In a survey conducted under the 'Offline Payments' case study, over 75% of consumer respondents had a favourable view towards an e-HKD incorporating offline functionality.                                                                                                                          |
|What is the role of the HKMA in the e-HKD project?                                           |The HKMA will continue its work under Rail 1 in laying the legal and technical foundations for an e-HKD in parallel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |This includes understanding its role in facilitating new ways of transacting goods and services whilst ensuring banking, monetary and financial stability.                                                                                                                                           |
|What are the potential benefits of a DLT-based design for an e-HKD?                          |A DLT-based design could be better for future interoperability compared to a non-DLT one, as transacting entities are likely to share a common architecture.                                                                                                                                                                              |This could be useful, for instance, when integrating a wCBDC with each financial institution’s tokenised deposits, where end-to-end integration and on-chain settlement are desired.                                                                                                                 |

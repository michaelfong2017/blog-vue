# Michael Fong's Portfolio
## 1. C-RAF 2.0 AI Assistant (React.js + Python)
The C-RAF is a structured assessment framework for authorized institutions (AIs) to assess their inherent risks and the maturity levels of their cybersecurity measures against a set of principles set out in the C-RAF, called “control principles”. Through this process, AIs will be able to better understand, assess, strengthen and continuously improve their cyber resilience.

</p>

The AI assistant will generate a summary encompassing all control principles based on the documents provided by authorized institutions (e.g. banks), along with the preliminary assessment result for each individual control principle.

## 2. 3D Echocardiography Viewer (Qt Widgets in Python + OpenGL)
### Objectives
Allow doctors to upload a DICOM file containing 4D heart data (a temporal sequence of 3D frames). The file is then uploaded to the server, which generates 7 cross-section views of a 3D heart frame. A 3D viewer allows doctors to view the positions and orientations of the 7 cross-section views in 3D space, and a 2D viewer allows doctors to view the 7 cross-section views. The 7 sets of cross-section coordinates are then applied to all the frames to generate 7 MP4 videos, which are ready for export.

## 3. Wukong - Desktop app for previewing RGB-D sensor data and displaying spine analysis results (Qt Widgets in C++)
### Objectives
Allow doctors to preview and capture RGB-D images of patients' bodies, which are used for analyzing whether the patients' spines are abnormally formed, and generating reports about such assessments.
<br>
<br>
Azure Kinect depth camera and Intel Realsense depth camera are both supported.
